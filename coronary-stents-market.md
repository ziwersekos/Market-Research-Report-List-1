<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary stents market comprises three main types: </p><p>1. **Bare-metal Stents (BMS)**: These are simple, metal tubes that provide mechanical support to keep arteries open but do not deliver medication.</p><p>2. **Drug-eluting Stents (DES)**: These stents are coated with medication to prevent restenosis, reducing the risk of artery re-narrowing after implantation.</p><p>3. **Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS)**: These are temporary structures that support the vessel during healing, gradually dissolving over time, thereby promoting natural vessel restoration and reducing long-term complications.</p></p>
