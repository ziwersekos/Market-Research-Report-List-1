<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS Sensor</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS image sensor market is primarily divided into two types: Front-illuminated (FI) and Backside-illuminated (BSI) sensors. FI sensors capture light from the front, making them cost-effective but less efficient in low-light conditions due to their pixel structure. In contrast, BSI sensors are designed with a reversed architecture that allows better light capture by placing the photodiode on the back, significantly enhancing low-light performance and overall image quality. BSI sensors are increasingly favored in applications like smartphones and digital cameras.</p></p>
